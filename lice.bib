  abstract = {This paper investigates the “weak” and “strong” versions of Porter Hypothesis (PH) focusing on the manufacturing sectors of 17 European countries between 1997 and 2009. The hypothesis that well-crafted and well-enforced regulation would benefit both the environment and the firm was originally proposed by Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995). To date, the literature has analyzed the impact of environmental regulation on innovation and on productivity mostly in separate analyses and focusing on the USA. The few existing contributions on Europe study the effect of environmental regulation either on green innovation or on performance indicators such as exports. We instead look at overall innovation and productivity impacts. First, focusing on overall innovative activity allows us to account for potential opportunity costs of induced innovations. Second, productivity impacts are arguably the most relevant indicators for the “strong” PH. As a proxy of environmental policy stringency we use pollution abatement and control expenditures (PACE), one of the few sectoral level indicators available. We remedy upon its main drawback, namely potential endogeneity, by adopting an instrumental variable estimation approach. We find evidence of a positive impact of environmental regulation on the output of innovation activity, as proxied by patents, thus providing support in favor of the “weak” PH. This result is in line with most of the literature. On the other front, we find no evidence in favor of the “strong” PH, as productivity appears to be unaffected by the degree of pollution control and abatement efforts.},

We examined (1) what are the main differences and similarities in enforcement between Finland and Sweden? and (2) how can crime prevention through enforcement be developed further based on these findings? The comparison is based on legislation, official documents and statistics. The findings suggest that a high rate of reporting crimes alone does not necessarily indicate more effective prevention of environmental crime, as pre-trial investigations quite rarely lead to prosecution. Most of the sanctions for environmental offences are monetary and quite small. However, in Sweden the use of the corporate fine is significantly more frequent than in Finland. It is concluded that, even though enforcement is essential, prevention of environmental crime, stressing voluntary compliance and administrative sanctions instead may be more effective in the long-run.},
